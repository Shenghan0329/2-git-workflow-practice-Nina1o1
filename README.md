# Webpage that I Love
This is a webpage that I find interesting regarding software development [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
This library is created here in **NYU**. The professor that was in part of the development process is in NYU Tisch, and he has a youtube channel that I LOVE called _Coding Train_.
This library helps students in art major, or any non technical major to use graphic design to assist webpage implemenetation.
